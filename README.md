# Fraction Calculator

## About Fraction Calculator

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created within the first few weeks of my class and
is very simple and follows exactly what my professor wanted. I am
limited on the methods and techniques I can use based on what we 
have covered in our class textbook. This assignment is coming from 
my third lab for the semester and is assignment two.

The instructions were to create a fraction calculate. The application 
is to be menu driven and gives the user options to add, subtract, 
multiply, or divide fractions. The application will check to make sure 
that the users inputs are valid.
